# Offer Search Engine
Take home assignement for Data Science Apprenticeship role.

In this project, we create an offer retrieval engine, where we are given a table of offers on variety of products from different retailers and brands. We are also given a separated table of brands and the categories of the product they sell. 

The user can make a natural language query to get offers on product categories, brands, or retailers. We have used entity linking, LLM powered semantic search and vector stores to create an end-to-end pipeline for supporting natural langauge queries.
